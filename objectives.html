      <p><em>What we call a videogame is not a product. It's the creation of an author and her accomplice, the player; it is handmade by the former and personally distributed to the latter. The videogame is a zine.</em> -- Anna Anthropy, <a href="http://catalog.sevenstories.com/products/rise-of-the-videogame" target="_blank"><em>Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</em></a></p>

    <p>By the conclusion of this course, you should learn to:<ul>
    <li>Iteratively develop, revise, share, discuss, and formally present an indie game protoype,</li>
    <li>Prototype an indie game that makes an argument about culture,</li>
    <li>Combine critical thinking about power, systems, and social relations with basic technical competencies in computing and materials design,</li> 
    <li>Approach indie games as social systems (not bundles of unrelated component parts), and
    <li>Demonstrate an awareness of various strategies used by practitioners to prototype games with social justice issues in mind.</li></ul></p> 

    <p>Student work will be evaluated based on a gaming "manual" (three marks), a presentation (one mark), and a prototype (one mark). Please note: this course is an introduction to game development and game studies. By the semester's end, students are not expected to be experts in game-making, and they are also not expected to build a complete game.</p>
