    <p>By the conclusion of this course, you should learn to:<ul>
    <li>Prototype an indie game that makes an argument about gaming culture, social relations, or systems thinking,</li>
    <li>Combine critical thinking in the humanities with basic technical competencies in computing and materials design,</li> 
    <li>Iteratively develop, revise, share, discuss, and formally present your protoype with an emphasis on games as systems (not a bundles of unrelated component parts), and
    <li>Demonstrate an awareness of various strategies used by humanities researchers to prototype games with social and cultural issues in mind.</li></ul></p> 

    <p>Student work will be evaluated based on a gaming "manual" (three marks), a presentation (one mark), and a prototype (one mark). Please note: this course is an introduction to game development and game studies. By the semesterâ€™s end, students are not expected to be experts in game-making or to build a complete game.</p>
