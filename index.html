        <p><em>What we call a videogame is not a product. It's the creation of an author and her accomplice, the player; it is handmade by the former and personally distributed to the latter. The videogame is a zine.</em> -- Anna Anthropy, <a href="http://catalog.sevenstories.com/products/rise-of-the-videogame" target="_blank"><em>Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</em></a></p>

		<p>HELLO! This is a course about making indie games. It's also about demystifying technologies and understanding videogames as arguments about power, systems, and social relations. I will not assume you're a gamer, that you want to be a gamer, that you've ever made an indie game, or that you know how to develop, program, or design games. But I will encourage you to craft an argument about culture through your own game prototype. In short, we're going to use games to talk about what games do, can do, or should do. Looking forward to it!</p>

		<h3><a id="week1" class="anchor" href="#week1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 1: PLAY + INDIE GAMES</h3>

		<p><em>What if some games, and the more general concept of "play," not only provide outlets for entertainment but also function as means for creative expression, as instruments for conceptual thinking, or as tools to help examine or work through social issues?</em> -- Mary Flanagan, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-play" target="_blank"><em>Critical Play</em></a></p>

		<p><li>TUESDAY the 6th: Introducing Us + the Course + Zines + Indie Gaming</li>
		<li>WEDNESDAY the 7th: Play and Indie Games (Lecture)</li>
		<li>FRIDAY the 9th: No Class (Jentery at <a href="http://www.mla.org/convention" target="_blank">MLA 2015 in Vancouver</a>)</li></p>

		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: This semester, you'll gradually develop a manual for your own game, which you'll prototype. (Details <a href="assignments.html">here</a>.) For your first contribution to that manual, mind answering two questions? First, what's an indie game? Second, what's play? For each definition, just use a sentence or two. No worries if your pithy definitions aren't that original. "Game" and "play" have been defined and redefined for centuries now. It's a mess, really. Aside from addressing these two questions, you might also consider subscribing to <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, if you don't already. Maybe install the <a href="http://unity3d.com/webplayer" target="_blank">Unity web player</a>, too? More important, please carefully review the entire course outline. You might want to play some of the games now, take notes on the topics we're covering, ask me any questions you have, and start brainstorming what sort of game you want to prototype. As the semester proceeds, I'll recommend specific readings depending on the trajectories of your work; however, it would be wonderful if you could play most, if not all (!!!), of the games in the course outline.</p>

		<p><em>To take play seriously is also to take the risk in play seriously.

		<li>WEDNESDAY the 14th: Paper Prototyping Some Characters (Workshop)</li>
		<li>FRIDAY the 16th: Sharing Your Characters (Peer Review) </li></p>
	
		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: Using whatever medium you prefer, sketch at least three characters (i.e., entities that act) for a game you want to prototype. For at least three of those sketches, please also provide brief character descriptions (50-100 words) that account for questions such as: What do your characters do? What don't they do? Are they player characters? Non-player characters? Are they human or non-human? How are they embodied? Under what assumptions? How do they interface with norms and expectations? How are they seen and heard? How do they communicate? Through what language? With what audiences and actions in mind? Are they based on people, places, or things that you know well? Are they based on existing games or fictions? During class on Friday the 16th, you'll circulate these sketches and get some feedback from others (including me). Then you'll gradually revise your characters based on that feedback. P.S.: You might find it refreshing to sketch a bunch of characters but only describe three of them. After all, I'm only asking for three character descriptions.

		<p><em>And more broadly, we need to ask whether or not games truly empower players to understand the systems they purport to describe.</em> -- merritt kopas, "What Are Games Good For?"</p>

		<p><li>TUESDAY the 20th: Mechanics and Values (Lecture)</li>
		<li>WEDNESDAY the 21st: Writing Some Rules (Workshop)</li>
		<li>FRIDAY the 23rd: Executing Rules, Enacting Assumptions (Peer Review)</li></p>
	
		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: Create some basic relationships between the characters you sketched last week. Write executable rules for these relationships. Make sure these rules could be written in binary, with corresponding keystrokes. Consider expressing your rules as subject-verb-object or if-then. You might find this exercise liberating or frustrating. Or both. Now, in 100 or so words (drawing upon material, including games, from the course outline), write about how these rules might ultimately correspond with or enact a social/cultural issue, which you could of course change later. That is, either implicitly or explicitly, what could your game be about, and for whom are you making it? Additionally, in 100 or so more words (drawing once again from the course outline), write about what the  "feel" of the game might be. Artsy? Activisty? Escapist? Fantastical? Realist? Abstract? Subtle? Forward? Short? Long? Simple? Elaborate? Snobby? Poppy? To be sure, this stuff will morph down the line, but it doesn't hurt to start thinking through it all. And, with other students in the class, you'll workshop your rules + relationships during class on Friday the 23rd.</p>

		<li>FRIDAY the 30th: Persuasion, Procedure, and Grammars of Action (Lecture)</li></p>
	
		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: You've sketched some characters and written some rules. Now sketch more characters (if you wish) and/or revise existing characters through new/edited sketches (if you wish). Please also make the characters' jobs in your prototype more concrete. You could do this in a number of ways: create profiles, write short biographies, provide sample interactions, or the like. Whatever your approach, in your manual just be sure to share all your characters, together with the actions for each. This way, you have a character + rule inventory of sorts. Please also describe or label how your characters relate. For instance, are their relationships premised on deceit, opportunity, love, power, verbal communication, body language, telepathy, envy, exploitation, sharing, capital, dependency, chance, distance, intimacy . . .? This description could also be expressed in a number of ways: through an "interaction map," simple sentences, tags, symbols, or some graphical representation. Your choice. Finally, please answer each of the following questions using about 100 total words (drawing upon material, including games, from the course outline): what kind of game (e.g., puzzle, first-person, platformer) are you anticipating here? 2D or 3D? To what games would you compare it? How many players are you considering (one, two, multi)? How will those players interact with your game (e.g., through what mechanics and controllers)? And do you think you'll build your game from scratch or mod an existing one? We'll start unpacking these questions as a class in February. For now, I'm just floating them by you. Again, I only need about 100 words total. Keep your responses to the questions brief, and get in touch with any questions or concerns.</p>

		<p><em>Games are activities, and activities are best understood when carried out.

		<li>FRIDAY the 6th: Prototyping Gadgets (Workshop) | <strong>Manual's Due</strong> (details below)</li></p>
	
		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: This week, we'll start moving from game prototyping in general to videogame prototyping in particular. In preparation, please review <a href="http://www.pixelprospector.com/the-big-list-of-game-making-tools/" target="_blank">these game-making tools</a> to determine what might be best for you. Try a few of them, if you have the time, interest, and patience. Some involve programming; some do not. Some are free; some are not. Some are genre-specific; some are general purpose. Some are cross-platform, but many are only for Windows. Aside from these options, you could also consider authoring your game in, say, <a href="http://programarcadegames.com/" target="_blank">Python</a> or <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/browse/?viewBy=tags&tag=game" target="_blank">Processing</a>, especially if you're modding something. Or you might look at super-handy options such as <a href="http://open.commonly.cc/" target="_blank">The Open Game Art Bundle</a>. I'm happy to help you here. And once you pick the best tool for prototyping your game, please write roughly 100 words about what the tool does and how, together with a rationale for why you selected it. In your rationale, please draw upon material, including games, in the course outline. In that rationale, feel free to provide sketches or screengrabs of the tool you selected. Please also keep in mind that I'm very open about how you proceed with your prototype. For instance, it does not have to be 100% digital or entirely screen-based. It simply has to involve some computational elements, which make it (if only in part) a videogame. Persuasive games don't need to be technical or flashy. P.S.: As you think about mechanics and engines, consider whether you want to collaborate with others in the class. Perhaps a shared engine or mechanic could be used for several different videogames?</p>

		<p>SOMETHING'S DUE: Please note that I will collect your manuals on Friday the 6th (end of class). At this point, your manual should contain definitions of "indie game" and "play," some character sketches and descriptions (at least three), some rules for your game prototype, a character inventory (i.e., characters + their actions), some descriptions of how your characters relate (or an interaction map), a statement on what technology you'll be using to prototype your videogame, a play log, and---finally---some thoughts on the kind of game you're prototyping, at least one social/cultural issue it's addressing, and some words on the overall "feel" of your game. Remember: your manual should clearly (even if casually) engage some games from the course outline as well as some research in game studies (including "related" material in the outline).</p>

		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: Thus far, the course has been largely about the mechanics, kinesthetics, technologies, and cultures of indie gaming. Now it's time to focus a bit on aesthetics and history. Use about 100 words (drawing upon material, including games, from the course outline) to address the following three questions about your prototype: what's its overall mood and ambiance? What (if anything) is it simulating? And how (if at all) is it drawing from history or historical materials? Together with these 100 words, compose a scene for your prototype using whatever is appropriate: paper and pencil, audio, Photoshop, photography, Python, video . . . As you do this work, think about your prototype as a fully functioning videogame: how it will sound, how it will feel, what its palette might be, and how people might engage it (e.g., point-and-click, text fields, gesture). In many ways, you're starting to build a world. But keep the world small or simple for now. You only need one scene, and you may only need one aspect of that scene (e.g., only visuals, only sound).</p>

		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: At this point in the course, you should be rather confident in the prototyping technologies you are using for your game. This week, please document where you are with the videogame aspect of your prototype. Add at least three screengrabs or photographs of it to your manual. Also, in 100 or so words (drawing upon material, including games, from the course outline), please address the following questions: how would you describe the relationship between time and space in your prototype (e.g., continuous, discontinuous, realistic, dependent)? How are time and space valued (e.g., through quantification, as territories, through exploration, as challenges, through chance)? Finally, how would you describe the relationships between characters and their environments, or between characters and their scenes (e.g., the environment as background, agent, character, or invisible feature)? These are big questions, but feel free to approach them descriptively through your prototype, which you'll continue to develop during class on Wednesday and Friday.</p>

		<p><em>[G]aming makes montage more and more superfluous.

		<li>WEDNESDAY the 4th: Sharing Your Prototype (Workshop)</li>
		<li>FRIDAY the 6th: Feedback on Your Prototype (Peer Review)</li></p>
	
		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: This week, all you need to do is provide at least three more screengrabs or photographs of your videogame prototype. These images show how your prototype has changed during the last week or so. Although you don't need to respond to the following questions in writing, you might want to think through them: what are the narrative dimensions of your game? Is it non-linear? Abstract? Realist? Autobiographical? Does it depend on the player's geolocation? In short, what's the story? Or is there even a story? On Wednesday and Friday, you'll have a chance to circulate your prototype in its current state and get feedback from others (including me).</p>

		<p><em>As a broader practice, hardware hacking enables a creative form of gameplay that does not necessarily follow the routine interactions intended by game companies. As such, circuit bending sparks a critique of ideology and engages in gameplay at its most operational level, without any false sense of transparency or immediacy.</em> -- Nina Belojevic, <a href="http://www.nanocrit.com/issues/5/circuit-bending-videogame-consoles-form-applied-media-studies" target="_blank">"Circuit Bending Videogame Consoles as a Form of Applied Media Studies"</a></p>

		<li>FRIDAY the 13th: Modding Prototypes (Workshop + Peer Review)</li></p>
	
		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: On Friday, you'll be modding someone else's videogame prototype, and they will be modding yours. In 100 or so words (drawing upon material, including games, in the course outline), please describe what you learned from how your prototype was modded. In 100 or so more words (again, drawing upon the course outline), please also describe how, under what assumptions, and to what effects you modded someone else's prototype. As you mod and respond to modding, you might return to our ongoing conversations about values, systems, power, and mechanics (among other things). Please also let me know what questions or concerns you have before, during, or after this week of mods, bends, and cheats.</p>

		<p><em>Gold farmers are reviled player-workers whose positions in the gamic
		economy resembles that of other immigrant groups who cross national borders in order to work, but unlike other types of "migrant" workers, their labors are offshore, and thus invisible---they are "virtual migrants."</em> --- Lisa Nakamura, <a href="http://lnakamur.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/donthatetheplayer.pdf" target="_blank">"Don't Hate the Player, Hate the Game"</a>

		<p><li>TUESDAY the 17th: General Prototype Development (Workshop)</li>
		<li>WEDNESDAY the 18th: Refining and Polishing Your Prototype (Peer Review)</li>
		<li>FRIDAY the 20th: Labour and Surveillance (Lecture)</li></p>
	
		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: At this point in the course, you should be refining your prototype. When in doubt, focus it instead of expanding it, keeping in mind that it's really a proof of concept about what your game could (or will) ultimately be. Make what you already have convincing instead of stretching beyond the time and materials at hand. Also, in your manual, please provide at least three more screengrabs or photographs of your videogame prototype. With it, please include 100 or so words detailing how playing your game could be considered an emotional, intellectual, sensual, casual, or embodied form of labour. Please also mention how and by whom this labour could be quantified, tracked, and shared. Speaking of labour: you're almost there! I'm looking forward to seeing what you've made this semester. Thanks for your work.</p>

		<li>WEDNESDAY the 25th: Preparing Your Prototype for a Demo (Workshop)</li>
		<li>FRIDAY the 27th: Demos (Peer Review) | <strong>Manual's Due</strong> (details below)</li></p>
	
		<p>FOR YOUR MANUAL: If you haven't already thought about how you will (or could) distribute your game, then this week's the week. In 100 or so words (drawing upon material, including games, from the course outline), explain how others could find your game. Also address the following: would you allow others to mod your game? How would you license it? How would you (if at all) follow it once it's in the wild? How much (if anything) would it cost? And how would you (if at all) get feedback on it? During class on Wednesday and Friday, you'll also have opportunities to demo your prototype prior to next week's formal presentations.</p>

		<p>SOMETHING'S DUE: Please note that I will collect your manuals on Friday the 27th (end of class). At this point, your manual should contain all the things, or---to be more precise---your responses to every instance of "FOR YOUR MANUAL" above. Remember: your manual should clearly engage some games from the course outline as well as research in game studies (including "related" material in the outline). Prior to submission, let me know what questions or concerns you have.</p>
