      <p><em>What we call a videogame is not a product. It's the creation of an author and her accomplice, the player; it is handmade by the former and personally distributed to the latter. The videogame is a zine.</em> -- Anna Anthropy, <a href="http://catalog.sevenstories.com/products/rise-of-the-videogame" target="_blank"><em>Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</em></a></p>

<p>The English Department (which administers all DHUM courses at UVic) uses the following scale for grading purposes: A+ (90-100), A (85-89), A- (80-84), B+ (77-79), B (73-76), B- (70-72), C+ (65-69), C (60-64), D (50-59), and F	(0-49).</p>

<p>I do not use plagiarism detection software when assessing student work, and final grades will be determined in accordance with the University’s <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/calendar2014/FACS/UnIn/UARe/Grad.html" target="_blank">official grading system</a>.</p>

<h3>N Grades</h3>

<p>Students who have completed the following elements of the course will be considered to have completed the course and will be assigned a final grade: 

<blockquote>the final game prototype and at least one mark for the game manual.</blockquote></p>

<p>Failure to complete these elements will result in a grade of “N” regardless of the cumulative percentage on other elements of the course. An “N” is a failing grade, and it factors into a student’s GPA as 0 (the maximum percentage that can accompany an “N” on a transcript is 49).</p>  

<h3>Circulation of Marks and Feedback</h3>

<p>I will not, at any time, post grades online, outside my office door, or in any other public forum. Grades will be circulated privately.</p> 

<h3><a name="rubric" class="anchor" href="#rubric"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grading Rubric for the Game Manual</h3>

<p><strong>A+</strong>: The content is persuasive, creative, reflexive, and supported by a significant amount of evidence. It not only meets the requirements of the prompt but also adds additional, interesting code, features, or design elements that were not required for the assignment. These additions augment the overall quality of the manual and demonstrate that you are learning more than what is being taught during class meetings.</p>

<p><strong>A- or A</strong>:  The content is persuasive, creative, reflexive, and supported by evidence. It not only meets the requirements of the prompt but also adds additional, interesting code, features, or design elements that were not required for the assignment. These additions augment the overall quality of the manual and demonstrate that you are learning what is being taught during class meetings.</p>  

<p><strong>B- through B+</strong>: The content is persuasive and supported by evidence. It meets the requirements of the prompt and demonstrates that you are learning what is being taught during class meetings.</p>

<p><strong>C or C+</strong>: The content is not persuasive, and it is not supported by evidence. It meets some requirements of the prompt.</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>: The content is not persuasive, and there is no evidence. It does not meet the requirements of the prompt.</p>

<p><strong>F</strong>: The content is missing and/or it does not meet any requirements of the prompt.</p>

<p><li>Write while you read material or play a game. For me this means annotating content as I engage it. You can annotate print and digital material.</li>

<li>Come to class with ideas and questions. Be curious. Seek connections between texts, between projects, between games, and between this course and others, even in other disciplines.</li>

<li>Take notes during class meetings. A significant portion of your game manual intersects with what we talk about in class.</li> 

<li>Let me know when you don’t follow what I’m saying. I am not aware of what you do not know or do not understand, and I may assume more contextual knowledge on your part than you have. I find this stuff fascinating, but I will not always know what you want to investigate or know more about---so please tell me.</li>

<li>Persuasive work takes time. Before you submit content, consider circulating drafts. Ask friends or peers to give your prototype or writing a gander. Come chat with me during office hours. </li>

<li>During class and in writing, be concrete when you comment on anyone’s work (including the materials we’re discussing). Quote it. Speak to specific elements. And then respond with your own interpretations. When the work is by a peer, be sure to affirm their ideas (e.g., “I like how you…”).</li>

<li>Use your game manual to share ideas and discuss material (including games) outside of class. If you have a question, then ask your classmates or me. If you hear something you want to remember, then note it for later reference. If you like the work your peer’s done, then tell them so. </li></p>
