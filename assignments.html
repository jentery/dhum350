<h3>Game Manual (3 marks, each 20% of your final grade)</h3> 

<p>Details about the game manual coming soon.<!--Almost every week, you will demonstrate what you are learning in Digital Humanities 350 via an entry in your "game manual." These entries are intended to be both brief and concise, and the main idea is to keep your contributions to the course fresh and consistent. For each entry, I will give you brief instructions (see the <a href="index.html">course outline</a>). There are eleven total log entries in the course; however, the number is subject to revision (i.e., an increase or decrease), depending on student performance and interests. You will receive the first mark for your research log during the middle of the semester, your second mark near the semester’s end, and your final mark during or after the exams period. --></p>  

<h3>Final Presentation (1 mark, 10% of your final grade)</h3>

<p>Details on the final presentation coming soon.</p>   

<h3>Final Prototype (1 mark, 30% of your final grade)</h3>

<p>At the semester’s end, you will submit a prototype for a game. Details on this assignment coming soon.</p>
