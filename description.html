      <p>For many of us, games are central to our leisure time. They are objects we purchase, play, and consume. But how are they made, and how do they help us think critically? In this course, you will prototype a game of your own, starting with a paper prototype and transitioning into a videogame prototype. Throughout the semester, you will also share your prototype, read research in game studies, and study gaming cultures.</p> 

      <p>This course is ideal for undergraduates interested in new media, game design, electronic publishing, and cultural studies. No previous experience with game design or culutral studies is required.</p>
